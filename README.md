# Learning Plan for New Programming Language

## Week 1: Basics and Syntax

### Day 1-2: Get Started
- **Install Development Environment**: Set up your IDE, and install necessary compilers or interpreters.
- **Hello World**: Write a simple "Hello World" program to ensure everything is set up correctly.
- **Basic Syntax**: Learn about variables, data types, and basic input/output.
- **Resources**: Official language documentation, introductory courses on platforms like Coursera or freeCodeCamp.

### Day 3-5: Control Structures
- **Conditional Statements**: Learn if-else, switch-case.
- **Loops**: Learn for, while, and do-while loops.
- **Basic Functions**: Understand function syntax, parameters, and return values.
- **Practice**: Solve simple problems on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank to reinforce syntax understanding.

## Week 2: Advanced Concepts

### Day 6-7: Data Structures
- **Arrays and Lists**: Learn how to manipulate lists, arrays, and their operations.
- **Dictionaries/Maps**: Understand key-value pairs and usage.
- **Sets**: Learn about set operations and use cases.

### Day 8-10: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Classes and Objects**: Understand class definitions, instantiation, and object usage.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Dive into inheritance types and method overloading.
- **Encapsulation**: Learn about access modifiers and encapsulation principles.

## Week 3: Practical Application

### Day 11-13: Libraries and Frameworks
- **Standard Libraries**: Familiarize yourself with the most commonly used standard libraries.
- **Popular Frameworks**: Identify and explore a popular framework related to backend development (e.g., Flask for Python, Express for Node.js).

### Day 14-15: Database Integration
- **Database Basics**: Learn about SQL and NoSQL databases; practice connecting and performing CRUD operations.
- **ORMs**: Explore Object-Relational Mapping tools available in the language.

## Week 4: Building and Deploying

### Day 16-18: Mini Project Development
- **Project Start**: Plan and start building a simple RESTful API.
    - **Features**: Include user authentication, basic CRUD operations, and simple data validation.
    - **Tools**: Use a chosen framework and ORM for database interactions.

### Day 19-20: Testing and Deployment
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for your application and ensure the code is robust.
- **Deployment**: Deploy your mini-project on a platform like Heroku or AWS, focusing on understanding environment variables and deployment pipelines.

## Mini Project: Simple RESTful API

### Project Description
Create a simple RESTful API for a "To-Do List" application. The application should allow users to:
- **Create** a new to-do item.
- **Read** the list of to-do items.
- **Update** existing to-do items.
- **Delete** to-do items.

### Features to Implement
- **User Authentication**: Implement basic authentication (e.g., JWT).
- **CRUD Operations**: Complete CRUD operations for the to-do list.
- **Database**: Use a database to store and retrieve data (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).
- **Testing**: Write tests for each API endpoint.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the API to a cloud platform.

### Tools & Technologies
- **Language**: Your chosen new programming language.
- **Framework**: A popular backend framework for that language.
- **Database**: Use a manageable database suitable for the project scale.
- **Version Control**: Use Git for version control.
