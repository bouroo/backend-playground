## Learning Plan for Mastering a New Backend Programming Language

### Week 1: Language Fundamentals & Environment Setup

**Objectives:**  
- Set up development environment  
- Understand syntax, data types, control structures  
- Write simple programs and functions  

**Core Concepts:**  
- Installation & IDE setup  
- Variables, data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans)  
- Conditional statements (if/else, switch/case)  
- Loops (for, while)  
- Functions and basic I/O operations  

**Hands-on Exercises:**  
- Print “Hello, World!” and basic arithmetic operations  
- Write functions to compute factorial and Fibonacci numbers  
- Create a simple command-line calculator  
- Implement basic string manipulations (e.g., palindrome checker)

### Week 2: Data Structures & Error Handling

**Objectives:**  
- Learn built-in data structures  
- Understand exception handling  
- Introduce modular programming and code organization  

**Core Concepts:**  
- Arrays, lists, dictionaries/maps, sets  
- Exception handling (try/catch/except)  
- Functions with parameters and return values  
- Modules and packages (import/export)  

**Hands-on Exercises:**  
- Implement a contact list using dictionaries/maps  
- Write a program to parse and validate user input with error handling  
- Create a module for basic math utilities (e.g., gcd, lcm)  
- Practice writing unit tests for functions

### Week 3: Object-Oriented Programming & File I/O

**Objectives:**  
- Learn classes, objects, and OOP principles  
- Work with file input/output  
- Understand simple database or data persistence concepts (optional)  

**Core Concepts:**  
- Classes, objects, constructors, methods  
- Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism basics  
- Reading from and writing to files (text and JSON)  
- (Optional) Basics of database connectivity or ORM  

**Hands-on Exercises:**  
- Design a class to represent a Product with attributes and methods  
- Implement reading/writing product data to/from a JSON file  
- Extend product class with inheritance (e.g., PerishableProduct)  
- Write a small CLI to load products and display them

### Week 4: Web Backend Basics & Final Mini-Project Preparation

**Objectives:**  
- Understand basic web backend concepts (APIs, routing)  
- Learn to structure a simple backend app  
- Design and start the final mini-project: Simple forum post with authentication

**Core Concepts:**  
- HTTP basics, REST principles  
- Simple routing and request handling  
- JSON serialization/deserialization  
- Structuring code for scalability and maintainability  

**Hands-on Exercises:**  
- Create a simple REST API endpoint that returns product data  
- Implement POST/GET requests with basic validation  
- Use a lightweight web framework or standard library HTTP server  
- Plan the final mini-project architecture and data structures for a forum post with authentication.

## Final Mini-Project: Simple forum post with authentication

### Project Overview:
Build a backend application that simulates a simple forum where users can create posts. The system should include user authentication (registration, login) and allow authenticated users to create new forum posts.

---

### Functional Specifications:

1.  **User Authentication:**
    *   **Registration:** Users can register with a unique username and a password.
    *   **Login:** Registered users can log in using their credentials to obtain an authentication token (e.g., JWT).
    *   **Authentication:** All post creation endpoints should require a valid authentication token.

2.  **Forum Posts:**
    *   Each post has an ID, a title, content, the ID of the author, and a creation timestamp.
    *   Authenticated users can create new posts.

3.  **API Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /auth/register` — Register a new user.
    *   `POST /auth/login` — Log in a user and return an authentication token.
    *   `POST /posts` — Create a new forum post (requires authentication).
    *   `GET /posts` — Retrieve a list of all forum posts.
    *   `GET /posts/{id}` — Retrieve a single forum post by ID.

4.  **Response Format:**
    *   JSON with appropriate data structures for users, authentication tokens, and posts.
    *   Meaningful error messages for failed operations (e.g., duplicate username, invalid credentials, unauthorized access).

---

### Technical Requirements:

*   Use the new programming language and an appropriate web backend framework (e.g., Express.js, Flask, Spring Boot, Gin, Laravel, Ruby on Rails).
*   Implement secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt) for storing user passwords.
*   Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or a similar token-based mechanism for authentication.
*   Code should be modular, with clear separation of concerns (e.g., routes, controllers, services, models).
*   Validate all inputs (e.g., username uniqueness, password strength, post content).
*   Include unit and integration tests covering user authentication and post creation.
*   Document code and API endpoints clearly (e.g., README with usage instructions and example API calls).
*   Persist user and post data using a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) or in-memory storage for simplicity if database setup is too complex.

---

### Validation Criteria:

*   Successful user registration and login with token generation.
*   Secure storage of user passwords.
*   Authenticated users can successfully create forum posts.
*   Unauthenticated attempts to create posts are rejected with appropriate errors.
*   Ability to retrieve lists of posts and individual posts.
*   Clean, readable, and maintainable code structure adhering to best practices.
*   Proper error handling and input validation across all endpoints.
*   Passing unit and integration tests demonstrating core functionality.
*   Clear documentation for setup and API usage.
